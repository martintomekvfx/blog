    <p>
      Welcome to my blog. I write about technology, art, creative coding,
      and the intersection of digital tools with creative expression.
    </p>

    <p>
      This site is built with <a href="https://astro.build">Astro</a>,
      styled with <a href="https://tailwindcss.com">Tailwind CSS</a>,
      and deployed automatically via GitHub Actions to GitHub Pages.
      Posts are written in MDX, which means they can include interactive
      components alongside regular markdown.
