# How to write a blog post with MDX

MDX is Markdown plus JSX. It lets you write a normal article and drop interactive React components directly into the post.

This blog supports that workflow, so you can keep writing simple and only add components when they improve the article.

## 1) Start with clean frontmatter

Every post should open with metadata:

```yaml
---
title: "Your post title"
description: "One sentence summary"
pubDate: 2026-02-17
tags: ["mdx", "tutorial"]
draft: false
---
```

Keep titles short, descriptions specific, and tags consistent.

## 2) Outline before writing

A simple structure works best:

- Why this matters
- Main steps
- One real example
- Wrap-up with a checklist

Use `##` and `###` headings so the table of contents stays clear.

## 3) Use code blocks for static examples

```js
export function slugify(text) {
  return text
    .toLowerCase()
    .trim()
    .replace(/[^\w\s-]/g, "")
    .replace(/[\s_]+/g, "-")
    .replace(/-+/g, "-")
    .replace(/^-|-$/g, "");
}
```

Use short examples that demonstrate one idea at a time.

## 4) Add interactive blocks only when useful

MDX components are powerful, but use them with intent.

<CodePlayground client:load code={`const headline = "MDX makes posts interactive";

const words = headline.split(" ");
console.log("Word count:", words.length);
console.log("Uppercase:", headline.toUpperCase());`} language="javascript" />

If a component does not improve understanding, leave it out.

## 5) Keep paragraphs readable

- Prefer short paragraphs.
- Add breathing room between sections.
- End with practical next steps.

## Publishing checklist

Before you publish:

- [ ] Title is specific
- [ ] Description explains the value
- [ ] Headings form a logical flow
- [ ] Code snippets are tested
- [ ] Tags match your taxonomy
- [ ] `draft` is set to `false`

Good MDX posts feel like normal writing first, with interactivity as a precise tool.
