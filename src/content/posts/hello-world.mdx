# Welcome to my blog

This is my first post. The blog is built with [Astro](https://astro.build), styled with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com), and supports MDX — meaning I can embed interactive components directly in my posts.

## The tech stack

- **Astro** for static site generation
- **MDX** for rich content with components
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **GitHub Pages** for hosting
- **GitHub Actions** for automatic deployment

## Interactive demo

Here's an interactive JavaScript playground. Try editing the code and hitting **Run**:

<CodePlayground client:load code={`const greet = (name) => \`Hello, \${name}!\`;\n\nconsole.log(greet("World"));\nconsole.log(greet("Astro"));\nconsole.log(greet("MDX"));`} language="javascript" />

## What's next

I'll be writing about technology, creative coding, art, and the tools I use daily. Stay tuned.
