# Editorial workflow for new posts

Great blogs are built by rhythm, not luck. This is the workflow used for this site.

## Step 1: Capture the raw idea

Write one sentence:

> This post helps **who**, solve **what**, in **how many minutes**.

If you cannot write that sentence, the topic is still too vague.

## Step 2: Build a short skeleton

Use this structure before writing paragraphs:

1. Hook (problem)
2. Context (why now)
3. 3 to 5 practical steps
4. Real example
5. Checklist / action items

This keeps posts focused and easier to finish.

## Step 3: Draft fast, edit slow

- First draft: no perfection, just momentum.
- Second pass: remove repetition and soft wording.
- Final pass: tighten title, intro, and section headings.

Your reader remembers clarity more than complexity.

## Step 4: Add tags intentionally

Use a stable set of tags. Good tags make your archive usable.

Bad tagging: too many one-off tags.

Good tagging: repeated categories that help readers find related posts.

## Step 5: Publish with a final quality check

Before publishing:

- Validate all links
- Verify headings order (`h2` then `h3`)
- Check code snippets and output
- Confirm `draft: false`

## Keep momentum

A simple weekly cadence works:

- 1 idea captured
- 1 draft written
- 1 post published

Consistency beats occasional perfection.
