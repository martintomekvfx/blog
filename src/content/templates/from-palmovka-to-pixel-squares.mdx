# From Palmovka to Pixel Squares

Urban space is overloaded with visual noise. In my own interventions, I keep returning to one primitive shape — the square — because it behaves like a focus anchor.

## Why a square

A square is not expressive by itself. That is exactly why it works:

- It does not tell people what to feel.
- It can be repeated across media (wall, frame, screen, projection).
- It creates visual rhythm in chaotic environments.

## Method

I test the shape in three layers:

1. **Street** — temporary placement in neglected corners and transit zones.
2. **Image** — frame and compositing experiments in film/VFX workflows.
3. **Interface** — interactive versions for web-based experiments.

The goal is not branding. The goal is to build a readable visual language that can travel between contexts.

## Closing note

If the city is a gallery, then each small geometric intervention is a way to open a conversation with passers-by who did not plan to enter any gallery at all.
